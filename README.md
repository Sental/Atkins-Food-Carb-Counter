# Atkins-Food-Carb-Counter
A Little Carb counter I designed for Atkins phase one food I like.
This is an evolving project to help me complete the atkins diet. Currently the switches are hard coded. The next step will be to swap them to something like xml sheets. This is another JavaFX project. It does use free information from the atkins website for the figures.
